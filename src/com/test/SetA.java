	 * This implementation differs from HashSet in that it maintains a doubly-linked list running through all of its entries
	 * Insertion order is maintained.

	 *  the set should be "wrapped" using the Collections.synchronizedSet method.
	 *  The iterators returned by this class's iterator method are fail-fast:

	 *   the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.
